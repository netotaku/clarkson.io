No Code platforms have long carried a reputation as second-rate — a compromise solution for those lacking technical skills or budget. But that perception is increasingly out of step with reality. 

While they do have limitations, No Code platforms now power serious businesses, launch startups, and support design teams at speed.

# A Short History of No Code

The idea of building websites without code isn’t new. Tools like Dreamweaver (and even GeoCities) were early attempts. But the modern No Code movement took off around 2015 with platforms like Webflow, Bubble, and Squarespace making it feasible to launch well-designed, interactive, data-driven sites without writing code.

This was supercharged by the explosion of integrations — Zapier, Airtable, Make (formerly Integromat) — which allowed users to stitch together business logic and automation without a traditional backend.

# The Major Players

* Webflow – Visually precise and powerful, popular with designers and front-end developers — the spiritual child of Dreamweaver, but modernised for today’s design workflows.
* Squarespace – A go-to for small businesses and content creators. Easy, attractive, and strong on structure.
* Wix Studio – Now gunning for Webflow’s space, offering increasing visual control.
* Bubble – Aimed at app-like functionality, with database-driven logic and workflows.
* Framer – A rising star, loved by designers and great for content and marketing sites.

## Why the Snobbery?

In my experience, No Code is often dismissed in agency or dev team environments for one of two reasons: lack of perceived control, and an outdated sense that “serious” work requires code.

But those perspectives often miss the point. No Code platforms **do** offer value — not just in reduced costs, but also in faster results, fewer bottlenecks, and easier collaboration.

## Where No Code Shines

### Rapid Prototyping and Iteration

Tools like Squarespace and Framer are excellent for content-first teams. You can build a proof of concept or working prototype that reflects real information architecture, not just a set of static mockups.

### Applying Design Directly in Browser

A recurring issue in digital delivery is “design fidelity”: when a beautiful Figma comp doesn’t quite translate in code. No Code platforms reduce this friction — the same person designing the interface often *is* building it, in the browser, in real time. However, this shift requires a change in process management and a reset of client expectations, particularly for those used to seeing signed-off creative before development begins.

### Out-of-the-Box Features

No Code platforms come loaded with SEO tools, social integrations, analytics, blog engines, video backgrounds, lightboxes, forms, CMS functionality — all without adding plugins or worrying about updates. Matching that in CraftCMS or WordPress (especially .org) takes time and effort.

> “No Code development is 4.6x faster than traditional development.” — Forrester, 2021

## The Limitations

No Code isn’t magic. And it’s *not* always the right choice.

### Server-Side Integrations

If your project depends on secure, server-side logic or complex APIs, many No Code platforms fall short. Workarounds are possible, but often shift complexity client-side — which can compromise SEO, performance, or data privacy.

### Scalability and Maintainability

What works brilliantly for a startup can become a tangle as the business grows. Projects with expanding feature sets can quickly hit platform limitations or accrue technical debt that requires migration later.

### Predicting Constraints

One of the toughest things with No Code is that its constraints don’t always emerge until late in the process. A platform might seem like a good fit until you need that *one* feature — maybe granular permissions, multilingual content, or a custom checkout flow — and suddenly you’re stuck.

## A Place in the Stack

Rather than dismissing No Code, it's more useful to ask: **what's the job to be done?**

* Do you need a landing page up next week? Go No Code.
* Is your client’s team already familiar with Squarespace or Wix? Leverage that.
* Are you iterating on content strategy or navigation? Use Framer or Webflow to explore.
* Are you building a secure, multilingual booking engine? Go custom — although it's worth noting that solutions like Squarespace are inherently secure and performant, making them viable for many use cases where custom development might be overkill.

The best development strategy isn’t about purism — it’s about pragmatism. Sometimes that means embracing the off-the-shelf.

## By the Numbers

* “77% of organisations have already adopted No Code tools.” — Gartner Survey, 2022
