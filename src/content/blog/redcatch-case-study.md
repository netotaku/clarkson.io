Redcatch Construction is a Bristol-based building contractor that needed a professional digital presence and visual identity. 

They had already approached a couple of agencies but were left feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what they were being sold. The project required more than just design — it needed a practical, empathetic approach that prioritised trust and clarity.

I led the delivery of a straightforward, confident brand expression and a Squarespace website that the client could understand and maintain. The result was a clean, credible online presence built around the client's real-world needs — not agency process.

## Challenges

- No existing brand assets or digital presence - Redcatch were starting from scratch — there was no logo, copy, or photography.
- A history of negative agency experiences - The client had tried working with two agencies previously and found the process confusing and demoralising.
- Limited scope and budget - This wasn’t a full-scale branding exercise or content strategy it needed to be lean, fast, and good enough to support growth.
- Client inexperience - With little digital knowledge on their side, I needed to educate while delivering — without letting the project stall.

## Approach & Client Collaboration

Rather than introduce more noise, I worked to simplify the process. From the outset, I avoided jargon and broke everything down into manageable steps. I focused meetings on what mattered to the client, translated digital concepts into plain English, and created a sense of calm and control.

This approach quickly built trust — something missing from their past agency experiences. That trust allowed me to move quickly and make decisions that added value, rather than pausing for permission at every turn.

Although the scope didn’t include full brand strategy, I approached the visual identity thoughtfully. I listened to how they talked about their work — dependable, no-nonsense, and clean — and used those cues to inform choices around typography, colour, and imagery. The logo is simple but bold, and the visual style carries confidently across vehicles, PPE, site hoardings, and now, the web.

## Delivery

- Squarespace Website - I selected Squarespace for its balance of flexibility and client-manageability. It allowed me to deliver a well-designed, responsive site quickly — and empowered the client to make updates without needing ongoing agency support.
- Visual Identity - Logo, colour palette, and type hierarchy were created to reflect the no-fuss, dependable nature of the brand — using design as a shorthand for trust.
- AI-Assisted Content - To accelerate the copy process, I used AI tools to generate initial case study structures and service descriptions, which I then refined. This kept us moving without the need for long-form content workshops.

## Results

- Delivered on time and on budget - The site and assets were delivered quickly, with no surprises or delays.
- Client confidence restored - Redcatch came away with a website they understood, owned, and could manage — and a sense that digital didn’t have to be intimidating.
- Brand presence established - Their new logo and visual language now appear consistently across workwear, vans, and signage — helping reinforce their identity both online and on-site.

## Reflections

This project was a reminder that good work isn’t always about size or complexity. Sometimes, the real value lies in helping people feel confident, heard, and in control. By making the process accessible and focused, I was able to unlock progress — not just in pixels, but in partnership.
