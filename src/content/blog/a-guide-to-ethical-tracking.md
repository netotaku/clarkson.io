User tracking has always been part of the web. From server logs to session IDs, developers and businesses have long been able to understand user behaviour without resorting to invasive methods. 

The real issues emerged with cross-domain tracking, where large tech companies, particularly Google, began aggregating user data across multiple sites — a practice that benefits them far more than it does site owners.

## Are Cookies Required for Tracking?

Despite common assumptions, **cookies are not technically required** for most types of analytics.

You can easily gather useful data — such as:

- Page views
- Referring sites
- Session durations
- Device types
- Entry and exit pages

…without placing a single cookie. What cookies enable is **persistent user identification**, which becomes especially problematic when that data is used to follow people across sessions or domains.

This kind of tracking is rarely necessary unless you're running complex personalisation or retargeting campaigns. In most cases, it’s simply overkill.

## Why Google Still Uses Cookies

Google’s primary business model revolves around advertising, not analytics. Google Analytics exists to support that model by providing detailed behavioural insights that feed into:

- Google Ads targeting
- Attribution modelling
- Conversion tracking

By linking **search queries** to **on-site behaviour**, Google can “close the loop” between intent and outcome. This makes Google Analytics immensely powerful — and, for many users, a bit creepy.

Although Google previously announced it would deprecate third-party cookies, it has since **delayed this plan multiple times**. Its proposed replacements (such as the **Privacy Sandbox** and **Topics API**) still favour Google's advertising goals, suggesting the **u-turn** is more strategic than privacy-driven.

## Do Most Websites Need That Level of Tracking?

In short: **no**.

Google Analytics is a sophisticated tool, but its power only becomes valuable if you have:

- Well-defined **KPIs** (key performance indicators)
- Clear **success criteria**
- The time and skills to analyse and act on the data

For most organisations — particularly SMEs or content-driven sites — basic metrics like page views and bounce rates are sufficient.

Even worse, Google Analytics 4 has **removed or diminished** some of the more accessible features, such as funnel visualisations, making it less usable for general audiences.

## Ethical, Cookieless Analytics Tools

There are several excellent, privacy-friendly analytics platforms available today that don’t rely on cookies:

|--------------------|------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Plausible**      | ✅         | From $9/month | Open source, GDPR-compliant, lightweight        |
| **Fathom**         | ✅         | From $14/month| No cookie banners, built-in privacy features    |

All of these provide reliable insight without invading user privacy.

## The Stickiness of Google Analytics

As of 2025, **Google Analytics is installed on over 55% of all websites**, including over 1.5 million in the UK. Despite GDPR and increasing awareness around privacy, most websites have not moved away. Why?

- It’s seen as the default choice
- Site owners believe it’s “free” (ignoring the privacy cost)
- Many use **dark UX patterns** to pressure users into accepting cookies

This behaviour, combined with an over-reliance on Google products, is arguably **damaging the open web**.

## Conclusion

**Ethical tracking** is not about doing less — it’s about doing what’s **proportionate**, **transparent**, and **user-centric**.

Unless your site has a well-defined measurement strategy, complex goals, and ties to ad spend, **Google Analytics is likely more than you need** — and may pose unnecessary risks in terms of privacy and compliance.

For most sites, **lightweight, cookieless analytics tools** offer more than enough insight — and send a clear message that you respect your users.
