As time has gone on, things have become more extreme—not just in politics, but across culture. Lines are drawn quickly, sides are chosen faster, and any hint of ambiguity is treated with suspicion. The middle ground, once a place for compromise and conversation, has become a no-man's-land.

Nowhere is this more damaging than in politics. In both the UK and the US, the space for nuance has all but vanished. Liberals and conservatives often speak in absolutes, not seeking understanding but victory. I've never felt comfortable discussing my politics online. I’m socially liberal and fiscally conservative—a stance that once felt balanced, but now seems to alienate everyone.

Interestingly, political divides consistently hover around a 50/50 split, suggesting deep-rooted psychological or societal factors. Research such as the study *Repulsion in Controversial Debate Drives Public Opinion into Fifty-Fifty Stalemate* indicates this equilibrium arises because opposing views often trigger a repulsion effect, reinforcing individuals' initial stances rather than fostering understanding. Furthermore, cognitive neuroscience research by Leor Zmigrod suggests that our political leanings might even be influenced by neurological factors, where individuals with more rigid cognitive styles resist ambiguity, deepening ideological divides.

Both political traditions offer value. Liberalism drives change. It embraces diversity, champions inclusion, and sparks innovation. That’s why so many pioneering companies were born in liberal environments. Conservatism, on the other hand, is about stability. It builds, protects, accumulates. Conservative capital often waits until industries mature before stepping in. This interplay—progressive experimentation countered by pragmatic consolidation—is vital. One without the other is reckless or stagnant.

However, the rise of political extremes disrupts this essential balance. Left-wing media personalities, particularly on platforms like YouTube, often mock right-wing views, dismissing them outright as ignorance. Conversely, right-wing commentators frequently engage in fabrications or exploit prejudice to gain traction. While legacy media outlets have their flaws—especially tabloids—the newer online media are proving even more aggressively partisan, fuelling further division.

Where are we heading? Without restoring respectful dialogue, we risk deeper societal fragmentation, institutional gridlock, and a culture devoid of mutual trust. But there is hope—a growing fatigue with outrage culture is emerging. People increasingly crave reason over rhetoric, calm over chaos. New platforms, communities, or conversational spaces might arise to amplify thoughtful, centrist voices. It won't be dramatic, but it will be crucial.

We must reclaim the middle ground. We must nurture mature conversations. We must remind ourselves that disagreement doesn't equate to disrespect. Without this, we risk losing not only civility but also the ability to progress collectively.
