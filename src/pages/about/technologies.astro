                        <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
                        <p>I build fast, accessible, and responsive frontends using modern frameworks like Vue and Astro, with a strong foundation in semantic HTML, modular SCSS, and TypeScript. I have worked extensively on accessibility and web performance, ensuring that every interface is inclusive, efficient, and delivers an outstanding user experience across all devices. My focus is always on maintainability, performance, and delivering smooth, intuitive user experiences.</p>

                        <h3>Backend Development</h3>
                        <p>I develop robust, scalable backends using PHP and Node.js, often integrating with APIs, GraphQL endpoints, databases, and third-party services. I'm experienced in designing both RESTful and GraphQL architectures, and in building secure systems that are easy to extend and maintain. I also incorporate automated testing into my development workflow to ensure reliability, catch regressions early, and support continuous delivery.</p>

                        <h3>DevOps & PaaS</h3>
                        <p>I'm comfortable managing deployments, CI/CD workflows, and infrastructure on platforms like Heroku, AWS, and Azure, as well as configuring servers and DNS when needed. I have considerable experience with Git, favouring Git Flow for structured collaboration, and have also worked with SVN in legacy environments. I regularly use Docker and DDEV to standardise development environments and streamline deployment. I value simplicity and automation, keeping projects efficient and resilient from build to production.</p>
