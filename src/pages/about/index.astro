				<p class="u-standout">With over 25 years in web development and more than 15 leading technical teams, I’ve delivered high-impact digital work across agency and in-house settings—from large-scale hospitality platforms to integrated CRM ecosystems. I care deeply about clean, maintainable code, purposeful design, and creating digital experiences that are ethical, inclusive, and resilient.</p>
				<p>I’m a pragmatic innovator: equally at home simplifying a solution or applying cutting-edge tools where they bring real value. My work spans frontend and backend development, API architecture, CRM strategy, ethical tracking, and AI-augmented workflows. If there’s a faster, smarter, or more elegant way to deliver, I’ll find it.</p>
				<p>Outside of work, I enjoy life with my blended family, keep fit by cycling, and stay creatively energised through <a href="https://nightofthevampire.com" target="_blank">electronic music production and DJing</a>, with releases on a number of indie labels.</p>
