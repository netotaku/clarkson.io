					<p>As a consultant, I help organisations navigate digital complexity with clarity and confidence. Whether I’m advising on Cyber Essentials and secure 
						development practices, or delivering talks on AI-enhanced productivity, Vibe Coding, and data-driven decision making, 
						my focus is always on practical impact. I bring over two decades of hands-on experience to every engagement—bridging technical detail with

					<p>My approach to web design and development blends creativity with technical precision. I focus on building fast, accessible, and user-centred websites that
						serve a clear purpose—whether thats conversion, engagement, or communication. I work full stack, from design systems and front-end UX to scalable back-end architecture, 
						always aiming for elegant solutions that are easy to maintain and deliver real value.</p>

					<p>I take a strategic, user-focused approach to CRM—designing systems that genuinely support customer relationships rather than just tracking them. I specialise in aligning 
						CRM tools with business goals, integrating them cleanly with websites and marketing platforms, and using automation and segmentation to deliver timely, relevant communication. 
						It’s about making the technology work for people—not the other way around.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">Bio</h2>

				<p class="u-standout">With over 25 years of experience in web development and more than 15 years leading technical teams, 
					I’ve worked across agency and in-house environments on everything from high-traffic 
					hospitality platforms to complex CRM integrations. I care about clean code, purposeful 
					design, and building digital experiences that are ethical, inclusive, and resilient.</p>
				<p>I believe in pragmatic innovation – knowing when to use cutting-edge tools and when to keep things simple. My work spans frontend frameworks (mainly Vue and TypeScript), backend systems, APIs, ethical tracking alternatives, and AI-augmented workflows. If there’s a faster, smarter, or more elegant way to do something, I’ll find it – and probably test it three times.</p>
