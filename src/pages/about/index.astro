					<h2>Blending experience, empathy and curiosity to build better digital experiences.</h2>					
					<p>With over 25 years of experience in web development and more than 15 years leading technical teams, 
						I’ve worked across agency and in-house environments on everything from high-traffic 
						hospitality platforms to complex CRM integrations. I care about clean code, purposeful 
						design, and building digital experiences that are ethical, inclusive, and resilient.</p>

					<p>I believe in pragmatic innovation – knowing when to use cutting-edge tools and when to keep things simple. My work spans frontend frameworks (mainly Vue and TypeScript), backend systems, APIs, ethical tracking alternatives, and AI-augmented workflows. If there’s a faster, smarter, or more elegant way to do something, I’ll find it – and probably test it three times.</p>

				thumb="fa-solid fa-envelope">	
					<p>I take a strategic, user-focused approach to CRM—designing systems that genuinely support customer relationships rather than just tracking them. I specialise in aligning 
						CRM tools with business goals, integrating them cleanly with websites and marketing platforms, and using automation and segmentation to deliver timely, relevant communication. 
						It’s about making the technology work for people—not the other way around.</p>
