					<h2>Blending experience, empathy and curiosity to build better digital experiences.</h2>					
					<p>With over 25 years of experience in web development and more than 15 years leading technical teams, 
						I’ve worked across agency and in-house environments on everything from high-traffic 
						hospitality platforms to complex CRM integrations. I care about clean code, purposeful 
						design, and building digital experiences that are ethical, inclusive, and resilient.</p>

					<p>I believe in pragmatic innovation – knowing when to use cutting-edge tools and when to keep things simple. My work spans frontend frameworks (mainly Vue and TypeScript), backend systems, APIs, ethical tracking alternatives, and AI-augmented workflows. If there’s a faster, smarter, or more elegant way to do something, I’ll find it – and probably test it three times.</p>
