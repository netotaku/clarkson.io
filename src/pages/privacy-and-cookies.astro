    subtitle="How we protect your data and respect your choices online.">                

    <p>We respect your privacy. This site is built around the principle of ethical tracking, with transparency and respect for user consent at its core. There are no UX dark patterns, no deceptive consent modals, and no attempt to harvest personal data for commercial analytics platforms.</p>

    <h2>Ethical Tracking</h2>

    <p>We use <a href="https://counter.dev">Counter.dev</a>, a privacy-first analytics service. Counter.dev does not use cookies, does not collect personal information, and does not track you across the web. It simply gives us aggregated, anonymous insights into how the site is performing — for example, page views or general geography (e.g. "UK", "US").</p>
    
    <p>This data helps us understand what content is useful and where improvements can be made — all without compromising your privacy.</p>
    
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    
    <p>This site only uses essential cookies necessary for its core functionality. We do not use cookies for advertising, remarketing, behavioural profiling, or third-party analytics.</p>

    <h2>Email Marketing</h2>
    
    <p>We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform. If you choose to subscribe to our newsletter, the information you provide — such as your name and email address — will be transferred to Mailchimp for processing. This allows us to send occasional emails regarding availability, service updates, or industry insights.</p>
    
    <p>By clicking below to subscribe, you acknowledge that:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Your information will be securely transferred to Mailchimp.</li>
        <li>You may unsubscribe at any time using the link in any email you receive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Access the data you’ve provided</li>
        <li>Request its correction or deletion</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent for marketing at any time</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Please contact us via email if you'd like to exercise any of these rights.</p>
